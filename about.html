Lots of nice moments are there during this period.The main reason for going to university is to get an academic qualification, but personally, I think that the social side of things and developing as a person are equally important. The good thing about university life is that you are left to your own devices, unlike school, where you're told what to do and how to do it. It's important to socialise and meet new friends. lt takes some people longer than others.  Still i miss my versity life.</p>

It is the formative period for everyone. Every student should try to make his better life and best use of school life because it never comes again after the school session.
